## Usage Recommendations

1. **Primary Entry Point:** Use `@Orchestrator` for all multi-step tasks
2. **Trust Delegation:** Let Orchestrator route work to appropriate specialists
3. **Respect Review Gates:** Don't bypass validation requirements
4. **Monitor First Runs:** Watch first 3 production orchestration runs for edge cases
5. **Reference Runbooks:** Use VALIDATION_RUNBOOK and RECOVERY_RUNBOOK as needed

---

## Next Milestone

**v0.5.0: Enhanced Observability (Phase 5)**

- Structured logging for orchestration events
- Execution timeline visualization
- Performance metrics dashboard

See [BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md) for detailed Phase 5 planning.
